NOTES
1) The MATLAB functions are wrriten in MATLAB version R2015a;

2) Before executing these functions, one needs to add all folders and subfolders to 
   current path in MATLAB;

3) "partTGL.mexw64" and "partTLeb.mexw64" in "Routines" are two MEX(MATLAB Executable) 
   files, written in C language and then compiled using the MATLAB's built-in mex 
   function and the Microsoft Visual C++ 2015 compiler on Win64 platform using MATLAB 
   version R2016a. 
   So if your default C/C++ compiler in MATLAB and/or the platform and/or the MATLAB 
   version are different from above, the compiled files (i.e.,"partTGL.mexw64" and 
   "partTLeb.mexw64") may not run properly. You need to re-compile the C codes:
   
   Step 1. Open MATLAB, and type the following command in MATLAB command window,
   
           >> mex -setup
		   
           mex will locate the installed compilers and choose a default compiler. 
           If you do not have an avialable compiler installed on your machine, you can
           visit the Mathworks website and check the supported compilers for your MATLAB
           (google "supported compilers for MATLAB version####"). Install a compiler, and
           then re-do Step 1.
		   
   Step 2. Set the sudfolder "C codes" in "Routines" as the current folder in the MATLAB
           toolbar. You will see the two C codes (partTGL.c, partTLeb.c) in the MATLAB 
	       current folder. 
			
   Step 3. Compile the two C codes by running the following command in the command window,

           >> mex partTGL.c
           >> mex partTLeb.c

           The c-mex invokes the selected compiler to compile, link, and generate the 
           binaries, "partTGL.mex###" and "partTLeb.mex###". 	
		   
   Step 4. Copy the new mex files, "partTGL.mex###" and "partTLeb.mex###", to the folder "Routines",
           and delete the previous "partTGL.mexw64" and "partTLeb.mexw64".

   Step 5. Add all folders and subfolders to current path in MATLAB, and have fun! :)

4) You can run the two functions ("DEFval.m", "RGDval.m") in the folder "Validations", 
   and obtain the Figs.7&8 in the paper.

5) You can run SGLRGD and SLGDEF without changing inputs, and obtain the Figs.9&10 in the paper.
   
6) The initial uniformly-distributed orientations and shapes of ellipsoids, used for running 
   the two multiple inclusion functions (MLTRGD and MLTDEF), were generated following the method 
   of Jiang(2007a) (“RandAANG.m” in “Routines”). If one wants to use some special inputs of shapes 
   and orientations of ellipsoids, one can simply delete the “RandAANG” line in MLTRGD or MLTDEF, 
   and use the new inputs.
